Hash is a culinary dish consisting of diced or chopped meat, potatoes and spices that are mixed together and cooked by themselves, or with other ingredients such as onions. The name is derived from French: hacher, meaning "to chop". Canned corned beef hash became especially popular in countries such as Britain and France during and after the Second World War as rationing limited the availability of fresh meat.
